# Traux-TMDB

Technical Flutter Challenge for Traux. The goal was to consume some APIs provided by the website: [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/), which aims to present the latest movie releases along with their details.

## Project Description

- Clean Architecture concepts were applied, following a structure similar to the Hexagonal Architecture.
- Riverpod was chosen for state management.
- The UI is a faithful recreation of the design proposed in the challenge.

## API Key Configuration

In the `lib/utils` folder, locate the `constants.dart` file and replace the value of `apiKey` with your API key obtained from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
